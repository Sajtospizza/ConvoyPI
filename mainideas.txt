Convoy optimizer algorithm features

Classes:

Number of cars should be changeable too!

Node:
- Id (int, should start from 0 with it being the spawn)
- Position (x and y, ints)
- IsTaken

Car:
- Id (int)
- Location (x and y, ints, needs to know if close to node)
- State (Idle, Carrying) - also tells if on node, can only be idle on node

Factory:
- Id (int)
- StartNode and EndNode (Nodes)
- ProcessTime (int, seconds)
- IsProcessing (bool)
- InputQueue length
- OutputQueue length

Optimizer: (Main class, basically the engine, setup and start methods)

Other variables:
- Resource timer
- Incoming resource queue
- Final product queue

Changing paramteres:
- Times and queue lenghts (3 timers and 4 queues)

Other ideas:
- Matrix for nodes next to each other
- Can car reach the position? Direction to go in
-
